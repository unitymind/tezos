Reset 2017-09-21
================

[Node]

- P2p: fix issue with data greater then 2^16 bytes
- Irmin: restore usage `git-repack`... (mistakenly removed)

Reset 2017-09-21
================

[Node]

- fix a performance issue in roll storage

[Doc]

- improve scripts and documentations on how to run sandboxed node
  or a local private network

[Client]

- add an option `-log-requests`. All RPC requests and responses to the
  node are logged on `stderr`.


Reset 2017-08-10
================

This update includes changes in the on-disk state of the node and in
the format of blocks and operations. It thus requires a chain reset.

Main changes includes:

[Doc]

- The documentation previously available on the Slack channel is now
  available at:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tezos/tezos/alphanet/README.md

- The `alphanet` branch of the github repository is now automaticaly
  synchronized with `alphanet` docker image. And the latest version of
  the `alphanet.sh` is available at:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tezos/tezos/alphanet/scripts/alphanet.sh

  No need to update manually though, the script auto-update itself
  when running:

    ./alphanet.sh restart

  Or:

    ./alphanet.sh update_script


[Michelson]

- minor language enhencements, mostly resulting from the feedback of
  Milo's daily challenge:

    http://www.michelson-lang.com/

- the alphanet scripts now understands a container: prefix wherever a
  file: prefix is accepted, temporarily copying the file into the
  container, and the emacs-mode is aware of that

[Node]

- Operations now include a block hash in their header. Such an
  operation could only be included in a successor of this block.

- The economics protocol now refuses blocks that includes an operation
  forged more 64 blocks in the past. As any constants set by the
  economic protocol, it is amendable by a vote.

- Header of blocks now includes a hash of the "context" that result
  from its validation. This is currently the SHA1 of the git commit,
  but this will be changed in a near future for a safer cryptographic
  hash.

- The node does not need anymore to maintain a full index of the
  operation to operate. This greatly reduce the memory and disk usage.

- The node now builds against `irmin.1.3` where some of our code and
  optimizations were upstreamed. We were previously stuck to
  irmin.0.12.


[CI]

- This is not directly visible in the alphanet, but our CI
  infrastrucre is now ready for open development.
  More about that soon (or later).
